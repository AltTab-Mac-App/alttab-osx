## What is AltTab?  

AltTab is a modern enhancement for macOS that redefines how you navigate between open apps and windows. Inspired by the familiar **Alt+Tab** behavior from Windows, it lets you see every open window in a clear, visual grid, making multitasking smoother and faster.  

The app is highly customizable — you can adjust key bindings, themes, and the appearance of previews to match your workflow. Whether you’re managing multiple desktops, using an external monitor, or juggling dozens of apps, AltTab ensures you can switch focus with a single gesture.  

AltTab isn’t just a clone of Windows’ switcher — it’s designed specifically for macOS. The app integrates seamlessly into the system, supports transparency effects, custom animations, and smooth transitions. It’s lightweight, efficient, and built for both **Intel** and **Apple Silicon Macs**.  

Ideal for developers, designers, and power users, AltTab gives you total control over how you move between tasks — helping you stay organized and efficient, no matter how many windows you have open.
